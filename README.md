# Emoji Recognized Tensorflow

This repository is the Python script I used to train the CNN for the [Emoji Recognized Project](https://github.com/spress-ai/Emoji-Recognizer).
Here is the link to the demo app: [emoji.spress.ai/](http://emoji.spress.ai/)

For privacy reasons, I cannot release the dataset publicly. 
However, you can [download the latest trainned model here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-cGnXdCLpSOjx-JhzVr8bdCcQcI3wfUT).
